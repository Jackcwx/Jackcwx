# Hi, my name is Jack Wilson,
  I am a full stack developer striving to create apps that people want to use.
  You can find some of my work here:

## Todo-Fullstack
  (React | CSS | Express.js | SQLite3 | Restful API's | Node.js)
  
  One of my first experiences building a full-stack application. This project gave me an opportunity to learn how the backend and frontend   of an application interact in an asynchronous way.

# Hi, my name is Jack Wilson,
  I am a full stack developer striving to create apps that people want to use. </br>
  You can find some of my work in the pinned projects on my github.

## Solo Project: Todo-Fullstack
  (React | CSS | Express.js | SQLite3 | Restful API's | Node.js | Dokku)
  
  One of my first experiences building a full-stack application. </br>
  This project gave me an opportunity to learn how the backend and frontend of an application interact in an asynchronous way.

## Group Project: NeighbourGoods
  (PostgreSQL | Next.js | Prisma | React | TailwindCSS | Auth0 | Vercel)

  Final Project from my full-stack bootcamp, in which I primarily worked in the backend and wrote API client hooks. </br>
  My group and I took this project as an opportunity to test our ability to learn fast by learning a new tech stack that wasn't
  taught to us in class in the week we had to build the app. 

  Deployed app: https://neighbour-goods.vercel.app/ </br>

## Solo Project: TDD-Bowling
  (Vitest | Javascript)

  A simple calculator to score a game of bowling, the process of writing the app was through test driven development in which I had to opportunity to learn about unit testing with Vitest.

  Dreamfest is a music festival scheduling project where I had the opportunity to learn about accessability in web applications as well as test driven development.

## Group Project: Bad Characters Good Vibes
  (Auth0 | React | Express.js | SQLite3 | superagent)

  Bad Characters Good Vibes is a tinder style game where users can upload characters for a community to vote on how good or evil they are.
  The project was teacher lead and our group members picked up tickets for features they wanted to work on. 
  I got to work with Authorizing, creating and managing user data. This project was another good opportunity for me to work in a full-stack application on both the frontend and the backend.
